# Emoji Prediction
This repository contains complementing code for the student project for Text and Analysis and Retrieval course.
Dataset was collected as part of the SemEval Task 2 competition.
Main goal of this project was to write a natural language processing research paper, "Using additional features in emoji classification", which was later published in
https://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/TAR-2020-ProjectReports.pdf .

Regarding the NLP pipeline, we used torchtext and GloVe embeddings, and for the machine learning models we used pytorch and sklearn.
Presentation ready code can be found on the branch "demo".
